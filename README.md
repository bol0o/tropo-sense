# 🌦️ TropoSense – A Self-Sustainable Weather Station

Troposense is a **low-power**, **standalone** weather station designed for **reliability** and **remote data collection**. It uses AVR microcontrollers to monitor and transmit meteorological data via GSM, with a focus on power efficiency and **modularity**.

For the full development log, **[click here](docs/dev-log.md)**.

## 📡 Features

- Monitors: **ground and air temperature**, **humidity**, **pressure**, **wind speed**, **wind direction**, and **rainfall**
- Built with raw AVR microcontrollers
- Modular 2-MCU system:
    - **Main AVR**: Gathers data from sensors
    - **Monitoring AVR**: Continuously tracks real-time weather activity
- Uses **GSM module** for communication
- Designed to be self-sustainable and efficient for long-term deployment

## 🔧 Architecture

### Main AVR
- Collects:
    - BME280 for pressure, humidity, and temperature
    - DS18B20 for ground temperature
    - Handles GSM communication via A7670E

### Monitoring AVR
- Continuously monitors:
    - Rain gauge
    - Anemometer (wind speed)
    - Wind vane (direction)


## ⚡ Power Efficiency

Troposense is optimized for ultra-low power consumption:

- Minimal power draw in idle states
- Efficient GSM bursts for data transmission
- Lightweight custom firmware on both AVRs

## 🚧 Work In Progress
